# 🍬 Sweet Shop Management System

A full-stack Sweet Shop Management application designed to manage sweets inventory, user authentication, role-based access, purchasing, and searching.  
The backend is fully implemented using **Node.js, Express, and TypeScript** following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles.

🤖 AI Usage Explanation

AI tools (such as ChatGPT) were used as a development assistant and mentor.
They helped in understanding requirements, planning architecture, clarifying TypeScript and Express best practices, and debugging failing test cases.

AI assistance was mainly used for boilerplate and repetitive tasks (route skeletons, middleware structure, common CRUD patterns).
All logic was reviewed, integrated, and debugged manually to ensure correctness and compliance with assessment requirements.
